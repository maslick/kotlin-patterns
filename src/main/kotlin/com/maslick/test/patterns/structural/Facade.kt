// Facade Pattern enables us to use a complex system
// more easily, either to use just a subset of the system or use the system
// in a particular way. We have a complicated system of which we need
// to use only a part. We end up with a simpler, easier-to-use system or
// one that is customized to our needs.

// The cost of writing this new class is less than the cost of every
// body learning how to use the original system or is less than you
// would spend on maintenance in the future.
